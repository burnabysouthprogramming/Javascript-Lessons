#Variables and Data Types

Variables are containers that hold values. Now the containers can be different sizes and hold different types of values. These are called data types.

Javascript allows you to work with three different types of data types:
* Numbers (decimal or not)
* Strings ("This is a string")
* Booleans (true or false values)

The importance of data types show when you try to print out different types of values.

Note: In other languages, there may be a difference between integer values and float values. In Javascript, there is no distinction and all numbers are represented by float values.
