#Operators
Arithmetic operators are used to perform arithmetic on numbers (literals or variables).

The point of using operators with variables is to let the computer evaluate an expression, instead of making the programmer do it.

```+```	Addition<br>
```-```	Subtraction<br>
```*```	Multiplication<br>
```/```	Division<br>
```%```	Modulus<br>
```++```	Increment<br>
```--```	Decrement<br>

```js
var x = 5;
var y = 2;
var z = x + y; //Addition
z = x - y; //Subtraction
z = x * y; //Multiplication
z = x / y; //Division
z = x % y; //Modulus (finds the remainder)
z++; //(Post)Increment - Adds one after printing to screen
++z; //(Pre)Increment - Adds one before printing to screen
z--; //(Post)Decrement - Subtracts one after printing to screen
--z; //(Pre)Decrement - Subtracts one before printing to screen
```

##More Complex Operators (Shorthand)
The assignment operator (=) assigns a value to a variable.
