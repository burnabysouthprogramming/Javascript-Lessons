#Exercises
1. Make a blank HTML page with Javascript ```<script></script>``` in the body. Or add onto a previous one and change the innerHTML of an ```id```ed item.
2. Create a program that prints the radius and diameter of a cylinder. Afterwards, it should calculate the __volume__ and __surface area__ of the cylinder with that radius. Print the volume and area to the screen by changing the innerHTML of an ```id```ed item

You will need a variable for radius, diameter, area, and volume __at the very least__. You will also need to make a variable for pi, in this case, you can create a variable with the value of 3.14. Review output methods from last lesson if you forgot how innerHTML works.

##Practice Concept Questions
1. What is the output of:

```js
var x = 16 + 4 + "Volvo";
document.write(x);
```

2. What is the output of:

```js
var x = "Volvo" + 16 + 4;
document.write(x);
```

3. What is the output of:

```js
var z = 5;
var x = z % 2;
document.write(x);
```

4. What is the output of:

```js
var z = 5;
var y = 10;
var x = 1;
x += z * y;
document.write(x);
```
