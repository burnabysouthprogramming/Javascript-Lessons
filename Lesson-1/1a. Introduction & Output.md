#Javascript Introduction

__What does Javascript do? What is Javascript?__

Javascript is a scripting language for HTML. It is used to change elements, change HTML attributes and styles, and show/hide elements.

The syntax uses __semi-colons__ to end a line, similar to CSS. The indentation is also similar to any other language.

##Script Tag

Similar to CSS, Javascript has to be added to HTML. The ```<script></script>``` tag can be added to the ```<head>``` or ```<body>```. Inside this tag is where you should be placing your Javascript code.

__However, it is best habit to put the ```<script></script>``` tags at the bottom of the ```<body>```. This is to prevent the page from loading too slowly because scripts slow down the page.__

Note: Instead of putting Javascript in the HTML, you can also have an external Javascript page that you link to the HTML page, similar to CSS linking.
