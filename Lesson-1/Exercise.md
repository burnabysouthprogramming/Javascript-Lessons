#Exercise

1. Create a new simple HTML page, with your own content. Add a couple of sections, paragraphs, and headers. If you're too lazy, use the HTML code [here] (https://github.com/burnabysouthprogramming/HTML-CSS-Lessons/blob/master/Lesson-1/Exercise.md) to add Javascript to.
2. Add ids to different elements in the page.
3. Add the ```<script></script>``` tag at the end of your HTML body to begin adding Javascript code.
4. Create 3 variables, named ```name```, ```description```, and ```age```. Assign values to those variables.
5. Use innerHTML to change the element of one id to the value of ```description```.
6. Use alert() to tell the user the name and the age when they first load the page.
7. Add more Javascript to the page if you wish.

Look back at the lessons or ask a friend if you are having trouble.
