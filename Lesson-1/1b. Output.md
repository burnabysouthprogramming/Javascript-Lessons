##Output
Javascript does not have any built-in print functions, so instead we can display data by:

* Writing into an alert box, using __alert().__
* Writing into the HTML output using __document.write().__
* Writing into an HTML element, using __innerHTML.__
* Writing into the browser console, using __console.log().__

These are all functions, except the innerHTML which targets an element. The functions take in parameters in the brackets that are displayed on the screen in different ways.

##alert()
```alert()``` creates a pop-up alert box on the page.

The words you put inside the brackets, in quotations will show up in the alert. 

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h1>My First Web Page</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>

<script>
var firstName = "Janet";
alert(firstName + " is awesome!");
</script>

</body>
</html>
````

Note: This example has a concatenation which is when you put strings, values, and variables together. Literal strings go inside quotation marks, while variables do not. In this case, the two strings are "added" together with a + sign.

##document.write()
In ICT classes, you will learn to use document.write(). This way of displaying data is commonly used for testing to write on the page. Using document.write() after an HTML document is fully loaded, will delete all existing HTML.
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h1>My First Web Page</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>

<script>
document.write(5 + 6);
</script>

</body>
</html>
```

##innerHTML
This is the most common method of displaying data on an HTML page. You will use the ```id``` attribute that defines an HTML element. ```id```s are like classes, except __you can only use an id once__.
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h1>My First Web Page</h1>
<p>My First Paragraph</p>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = 5 + 6;
</script>

</body>
</html>
```

##console.log()
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h1>My First Web Page</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>

<script>
console.log(5 + 6);
</script>

</body>
</html>
```
